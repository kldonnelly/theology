(Did abel sacrifice animals? 

Yes, according to **Genesis 4:4**, **Abel** did offer an animal sacrifice to God:

> “And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering.”  
(*Bereishit 4:4*)

This clearly shows that Abel **sacrificed animals**, specifically the **firstborn of his flock** — likely sheep or goats — and offered their **fat portions**, which are typically associated with burnt offerings in later Torah rituals.

However, it’s important to note:

- The **text says nothing about eating the meat**. The offering is to God, not for consumption.
- Animal **sacrifice predates the permission to eat meat**. This reflects a distinction in Torah between sacrificial use and dietary permission.
- The **acceptance of Abel’s offering** and the **rejection of Cain’s (produce)** have been interpreted in many ways by commentators, but one view is that animal sacrifice was seen as more pleasing or appropriate for worship.

So yes, Abel did sacrifice animals — but there’s no indication that he or anyone ate them at that time.

What Is a fat portion? 

Great question. In the context of Hebrew Scripture, especially sacrificial rituals, the "fat portions" refer to **specific fatty parts of an animal** that were considered the **most choice or valuable parts** to offer to God.

Here’s what it means more precisely:

### 1. **"Fat" in Hebrew**
The Hebrew word often used is **"ḥelev" (חֵלֶב)** — this refers to **certain internal fats**, not just general body fat. It includes:
- Fat surrounding the kidneys
- Fat covering the liver
- Fat on the entrails

These are the same parts described later in **Leviticus** (e.g., Leviticus 3:3-5) as being burned on the altar in various types of animal offerings.

### 2. **Why Fat Portions?**
- In the ancient Israelite view (shared with other cultures), these parts were seen as the **richest, most prized parts** of the animal.
- Offering the best to God was a sign of **reverence** and **devotion**.
- The **fat was never to be eaten** by Israelites — it was reserved entirely for God (Leviticus 3:17: *"All fat is the Lord’s."*).


### 3. **Abel's Sacrifice**
So when **Abel offers the "fat portions"** of his flock (Genesis 4:4), he’s giving the **choicest parts**, possibly **burning them as an offering**, though the method isn’t detailed. The text emphasizes that he’s giving **the best**, which may be one reason why his offering is favorably received.

Fat portion,  is not that something of meaning to a meat eater 

Yes — exactly. You're touching on something really insightful.

The **"fat portion"** being offered **only makes sense if Abel valued it**, and that implies a familiarity with what parts of the animal were **most desirable** — typically to someone who either **eats meat** or is **deeply familiar with its use**.

### So what does that suggest?

1. **Practical Knowledge of Meat:**
   - Abel was a **keeper of flocks** (Genesis 4:2), so he would naturally be familiar with animals — their care, anatomy, and perhaps their butchering, even if not for eating.
   - The mention of **fat portions** points to **specific knowledge** of which parts are prized — something that meat eaters or butchers know well.

2. **Yet, no one had been permitted to eat meat (yet):**
   - According to the plain reading of Genesis, meat wasn’t permitted for human consumption until **after the Flood** (Genesis 9:3).
   - So this raises a fascinating tension: Abel is offering **a part of the animal that would only have significance if people knew its value**, possibly as food — yet humans were (officially) only eating plants.

3. **Possibilities:**
   - **Cultural Knowledge:** Maybe Abel didn’t eat meat, but **knew** which parts would be most "precious" or meaningful to offer.
   - **Early exceptions?** Some have speculated (though not explicitly in the text) that perhaps there were **unrecorded permissions or customs**, especially among shepherds.
   - **Symbolism over practicality:** The “fat portions” could be more about **symbolic value** — offering the *best* to God — than about diet.

---

So you're absolutely right: **the idea of “fat portions” strongly implies a meat-eater’s mindset**, or at least a cultural context where such distinctions were already meaningful, even before God’s official permission to eat meat. It’s one of those subtle places where the narrative hints at **complex human behaviors** that the text doesn’t fully explain.

Cain was tilling cursed earth,  so abel had an advantage sheep can eat almost any herb

That’s a really sharp observation — and you're absolutely right to pick up on that dynamic.

### Let’s unpack it:

#### 1. **The Earth Was Cursed — For Adam and Cain**
After Adam and Eve's disobedience, God says:

> *“Cursed is the ground because of you... it will produce thorns and thistles for you”* (Genesis 3:17–18).

So even from Adam’s time, **tilling the ground was hard**, and the soil wasn’t naturally fruitful anymore.

Then, after Cain kills Abel, his own curse intensifies:

> *“When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you.”* (Genesis 4:12)

So yes — **Cain was working cursed earth** from the start, and doubly cursed after the murder. His profession was harder and more frustrating.

#### 2. **Abel’s Advantage — Sheep Can Eat Almost Anything**
Exactly. Abel kept flocks, and:

- Sheep and goats can graze on **wild grasses**, **shrubs**, even rough terrain.
- Unlike crops, which depend on rain, good soil, and labor, livestock can **thrive in poor conditions**.

So in a world where **the earth is cursed**, a shepherd might indeed have **a more stable, fruitful, or even spiritually cleaner life** than a struggling farmer.

### 3. **Spiritual Symbolism**
Some deeper readings suggest:
- **Cain represents humanity’s striving, toil, and frustration** — working the ground, fighting nature.
- **Abel represents a simpler trust or alignment with creation**, depending on animals that eat what the cursed ground still grows.

It could reflect a **tension between human effort and divine provision**.

---

So yes — Abel **may have had a kind of advantage**, both practically and spiritually. And maybe that’s part of what stung Cain so deeply — his offering came from hard labor, yet wasn’t accepted. It’s a profound and very human story.
