You're absolutely correct that Proverbs emphasizes wisdom as a divine attribute and gift from God, but it does not equate any of God's creations with God Himself. Let’s explore this in more detail and clarify how Proverbs relates to the concept of wisdom and how it differs from the theological claims about Jesus in John 1:1.

### **Wisdom in Proverbs**
In Proverbs, wisdom is personified as a woman (e.g., Proverbs 1:20-33, 8:1-36) and is described as being present with God during creation. For example:

- **Proverbs 8:22-31**:  
  Wisdom speaks of being "brought forth" by God before the world was created, acting as a master craftsman beside Him during creation. This poetic personification of wisdom highlights its divine origin and importance, but it does not imply that wisdom is a separate divine being or equal to God.

- **Wisdom as a Gift**:  
  Throughout Proverbs, wisdom is presented as a gift from God that humans can seek and acquire (Proverbs 2:6, 9:10). It is not an independent entity but rather an attribute of God that reflects His character and order in creation.

### **Key Differences Between Proverbs and John 1:1**
While Proverbs and John 1:1 both use poetic language to describe divine concepts, they differ significantly in their theological claims:

1. **Nature of Wisdom in Proverbs**:  
   - Wisdom in Proverbs is a created attribute of God, not a person or deity.  
   - It is something God possesses and shares with His creation, but it is not equated with God Himself.

2. **Nature of the Logos in John 1:1**:  
   - The *Logos* (Word) in John 1:1 is not merely an attribute or creation of God but is identified as God Himself.  
   - John 1:1 explicitly states, "the Word was God," affirming the divinity of the *Logos*.  
   - The *Logos* is also described as the agent of creation (John 1:3), not as a created being.

3. **Purpose of the Texts**:  
   - Proverbs aims to teach practical wisdom and reverence for God, emphasizing how humans can live in alignment with God's order.  
   - John 1:1 aims to reveal the identity of Jesus Christ as the eternal, divine *Logos* who became flesh (John 1:14) and is central to God's plan of salvation.

### **Is John 1:1 Misusing Proverbs?**
John 1:1 is not directly quoting or misusing Proverbs but is drawing on a broader biblical theme of God's Word and wisdom to reveal the identity of Jesus. Here’s how the two concepts relate:

1. **Continuity**:  
   Both Proverbs and John 1:1 emphasize the role of divine wisdom/Word in creation. Proverbs personifies wisdom as being present with God during creation, while John identifies the *Logos* as the divine agent through whom all things were made.

2. **Development**:  
   John 1:1 goes beyond Proverbs by identifying the *Logos* not just as a divine attribute or creation but as God Himself. This is a theological development that reflects the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the incarnate Son of God.

3. **Distinction**:  
   Proverbs does not claim that wisdom is God, whereas John 1:1 explicitly identifies the *Logos* as God. This distinction is crucial for understanding the unique Christian claim about Jesus' divinity.

### **Conclusion**
Proverbs teaches that wisdom is a divine attribute and gift from God, but it does not equate wisdom with God Himself. John 1:1, on the other hand, presents the *Logos* (Word) as both divine and personal, identifying Jesus as God. While John 1:1 may draw on the imagery and themes of wisdom from Proverbs, it does not misrepresent them but rather develops them in light of the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ. The two texts serve different purposes: Proverbs emphasizes the pursuit of wisdom, while John 1:1 reveals the divine identity of Jesus as the eternal Word of God.
