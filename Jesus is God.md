The belief that Jesus is God is central to Christian theology and is rooted in several key aspects of the New Testament and early Christian teachings. Here are the primary reasons why Jesus is considered divine:

1. **Biblical Testimony**: The New Testament, particularly the Gospels, contains numerous passages that affirm Jesus' divinity. For example:
   - In [John](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201&version=NIV) 1:1, it states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Later in John 1:14, it says, "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us," referring to Jesus.
   - In John 10:30, Jesus says, "I and the Father are one," indicating a unity with God.
   - In John 20:28, Thomas addresses Jesus as "My Lord and my God!" after the resurrection.

2. **Jesus' Claims**: Throughout the Gospels, Jesus makes several claims that imply his divinity:
   - He forgives sins, which is something only God can do ([Mark](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202%3A5-7&version=KJV) 2:5-7).
   - He accepts worship, which is reserved for God alone (Matthew 14:33, John 9:38).
   - He claims to have existed before Abraham (John 8:58), implying eternal existence.

3. **Miracles and Resurrection**: Jesus' miracles, including healing the sick, raising the dead, and controlling nature, are seen as signs of his divine authority. His resurrection from the dead is considered the ultimate proof of his divinity, as it demonstrates power over life and death.

4. **Early Christian Creeds**: The early Christian church formulated creeds that affirmed Jesus' divinity. The Nicene Creed (325 AD) states that Jesus is "true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father."

5. **Theological Reflection**: Early Christian theologians, such as Augustine and Athanasius, developed the doctrine of the Trinity, which holds that God exists as three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who are one in essence. Jesus, as the Son, is fully God.

6. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**: Jesus is seen as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, who would be both a human descendant of David and divine (Isaiah 9:6, Micah 5:2).

7. **Experience of the Early Church**: The early Christians experienced the presence and power of Jesus in their lives, particularly through the Holy Spirit, which they believed was sent by Jesus after his ascension (Acts 2). This experiential knowledge reinforced their belief in his divinity.

In summary, the belief that Jesus is God is based on biblical testimony, Jesus' own claims, his miracles and resurrection, early Christian creeds, theological reflection, fulfillment of prophecy, and the experiential knowledge of the early church. This belief is foundational to Christian faith and has been upheld by the majority of Christian traditions throughout history.
