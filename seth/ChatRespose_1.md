Seth, the non-physical entity channeled by Jane Roberts, had very specific views about violence, including the act of killing another person. In the Seth Material, he emphasizes the sanctity of all life, the deep interconnectedness of consciousness, and the karmic and spiritual implications of actions such as murder.

Here are some key points Seth made about killing another person, with references where possible:

---

### 1. **The Sacredness of Life**
Seth consistently stressed that **all life is sacred**, and taking another's life is a profound violation of the natural spiritual order.

> “Life is sacred – all life – and again, all life contains consciousness, and is of the same source as your own.”  
> – *Seth Speaks*, Chapter 12

---

### 2. **Violence Reflects Inner Conflict**
Seth taught that **acts of violence**, including murder, are external manifestations of **inner turmoil or unresolved conflicts** within the self.

> “Violence is not a solution. It is an admission of spiritual ignorance, and a closing off of the self from the more expansive reaches of consciousness.”  
> – *The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events*, Chapter 2

---

### 3. **Karmic and Spiritual Consequences**
Seth did not believe in punishment in the traditional religious sense, but he **did emphasize natural consequences**—what you do to another, you do to yourself, since all consciousness is interconnected.

> “When you kill another, you kill a portion of yourself. There is no escape from this, for all beings are connected.”  
> – *Seth Speaks*, Chapter 15

---

### 4. **There Is No Justifiable Killing**
Seth rejected the idea that killing can be justified by context (such as war or self-defense), suggesting that the **justification is a mental construct** and not a spiritual truth.

> “No cause justifies the killing of another. The cause itself is a symptom of inner imbalance.”  
> – *The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events*, Chapter 3

---

### 5. **Reincarnational Perspective**
From the Seth perspective, all individuals choose their experiences on a soul level, even traumatic ones. However, this **does not excuse violence**, but rather frames it as part of a broader tapestry of learning and growth.

> “The murderer and the victim have agreed, on other levels, to meet in this way. But that does not excuse the act—it only explains it from the viewpoint of a larger framework of existence.”  
> – *Seth Speaks*, Chapter 13

If you want a deeper look, I recommend starting with:
- *Seth Speaks* (1972)
- *The Nature of Personal Reality* (1974)
- *The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events* (1981)
