animals in the framework of their experience. Strictly speaking, the 
translation from biological language to your own is as given in this 
session; but the finer discrimination reads thusly: Thou shalt not violate.

The animals do not need such a message, of course, nor can it be 
literally translated, for your consciousness is flexible and 
leeway had to be left for your own interpretation.

An outright lie may or may not be a violation. 
A sex act may or may not be a violation. 
A scientific expedition may or may not be a violation. 
Not going to church on Sunday is not a violation.
Having normal aggressive thoughts is not a violation. 
Doing violence to your body, or another's, is a violation. 
Doing violence to the spirit of another is a violation — but again,
because you are conscious beings the interpretations are yours. 
Swearing is not a violation. If you believe that it is then in your mind it becomes one.

(12:01.) Killing another human being is a violation. 
Killing while protecting your own body from death at the hands of 
another through immediate contact is a violation. Whether or not 
any justification seems apparent, the violation exists.

(Long pause.) Because you believe that physical self-defense 
is the only way to counter such a situation then you will say, 
"If I am attacked by another person, are you telling me that 
I cannot aggressively counter his obvious intent to destroy me?"

Not at all. You could counter such an attack in several ways 
that do not involve killing. You would not be in such a 
hypothetical situation to begin with unless violent thoughts 
of your own, faced or unfaced, had attracted it to you. 
But once it is a fact, and according to the circumstances, 
many methods could be used. Because you consider aggression 
synonymous with violence, you may not understand that aggressive — forceful, 
active, mental or spoken — commands for peace could save your 
life in such a case; yet they could.

Usually there are a variety of physical actions, 
not involving killing, that would suffice. As long as you believe 
that violence must be met with violence you court it and its consequences. 
On individual terms, your own body and mind become the battleground, 
as does the physical body of the earth in mass terms. Your material 
form is alive through natural aggression, the poised, forceful 
and directed action that is the carrier for creativity.
